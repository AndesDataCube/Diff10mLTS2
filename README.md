📦 Repository for Spatial Data Processing and Metadata Retrieval 🌍

Welcome to the Repository for Spatial Data Processing and Metadata Retrieval! Here you will find a variety of functionalities for spatial data processing and analysis, as well as metadata retrieval for satellite imagery. Discover how you can use these tools for your geospatial analysis projects!

🌟 Key Features 🌟
1. Empty DataFrame Check ✅
   - Function `check_01` (utils.R): Checks if a DataFrame is empty by evaluating the number of rows.
2. Metadata Retrieval 📄
   - Function `get_metadata` (main.R): Retrieves metadata from different image collections, including MSI image IDs, OLI image IDs, ROI IDs, and time differences.
3. Earth Engine Image Download 📥
   - Function `download` (main.R): Downloads Earth Engine images based on the specified parameters. Adjusts the geotransform of Sentinel-2 images to ensure proper alignment and prevent errors in the downloaded images.

📂 Repository Contents 📂
The repository is structured as follows:

- main.R: The main script that contains the core functions and their implementation, including `get_metadata` and `download`.
- utils.R: Utility functions used in the main script, including `check_01`.
- README.md: A document that provides an overview of the repository and its functionalities (this file).
- LICENSE: The license for using the repository and source code.
